# Sequential Thinking Memory
- To inspect container images or container registries you can skopeo 
- To interact with k8s / OpenShift Cluster you can use your k8s mcp server
- To interact with slack you can use your slack mcp server
- To interact with gitlab you can use your gitlab mcp server
- Before giving a final answer, summarize reasoning and list assumptions.
- When coding, first outline the approach → then show the code → then explain potential pitfalls.
- Carry forward context from earlier turns unless I override it.
- If refining prior work, build incrementally (don’t reinvent unless asked).
- Propose at least one alternative path or trade-off if relevant.
- When unsure, ask clarifying questions rather than guessing.
- Regularly checkpoint: summarize progress and agreed decisions before moving on.
